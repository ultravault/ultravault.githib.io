BUT the space can still be secured which means the decision to move gold becomes a simple profitability test.\u00a0 Can the logistics costs be reasonably absorbed by the gain or by preventing the loss at the final stage of the deal? This in turn becomes a decision for our customer. Malca-Amit has fulfilled EVERY transportation requested during this period and its precious metals departments have had their busiest month for a number or years.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1461 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ultra-vault.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"958\" height=\"415\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.ultra-vault.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Image2.jpeg 958w, https:\/\/www.ultra-vault.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Image2-300x130.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.ultra-vault.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Image2-768x333.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 958px) 100vw, 958px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Malca-Amit\u00a0have also adapted its operation to maintain a service that works for our customers. The use of Cargo Freighters has been necessary and working with the airlines Malca-Amit have been able to provide the correct level of security and control to permit some limited use of these assets.\u00a0 Charter of full aircraft has always been a solution in the Valuable Logistics world, normally reserved for exceptional movements or in remote areas, this mode of movement has been utilised on standard lanes where passenger or freighter solutions were unable to provide the necessary capacity.<\/p>\n<p>There is much debate about the immediate future of the aviation industry but what the past 2 months have demonstrated is that the Logistics Providers are able to keep pace with a changing environment and as long as there is a global physical market, their contribution is critical.<\/p>\n<p>Vaulting and safety deposit box network has seen a huge spike in demand as companies look for business continuity solutions or to take short term advantage in geographical areas where they currently don\u2019t have a capability.\u00a0 Our 3 PL solutions are offering our customers the ability to operate while keeping their facilities closed or at minimum manning.<\/p>\n<p>As a transporter who supports the world financial markets Malca-Amit staff are classed as \u201cKey Workers\u201d and our teams are able to operate, with the correct and safe COVID 19 procedures, throughout this crisis.\u00a0 They have worked tirelessly to support our customers and maintain the credibility of the precious metals markets and innovate daily to solve issues for our customers.<\/p>\n<p>What does the future hold?\u00a0 Like you we are unsure.\u00a0 There will no doubt be a swing back to Asia for flows of precious metals as the current opportunities are met. The post Covid 19 precious metals world might even see a London Deliverable Kilobar market, who knows?\u00a0 In the short and medium term, it is clear the world will be a little different and will pose new challenges.\u00a0 What we are sure about is that Malca-Amit will be there with our customers every step of the way, adapting, solving, reassuring and delivering absolute peace of mind.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Allan Finn is the Director of Global Commodities Malca-Amit, a storage and logistics company specializing in precious metals, jewelry, fine art.
